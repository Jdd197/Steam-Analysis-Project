Project started as part of auditing an EDX course on Python + Data Analysis to learn and improve my python skills.

Data taken from a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data) which utilises code attributed under the MIT license.

This project is still very much a work in progress.
